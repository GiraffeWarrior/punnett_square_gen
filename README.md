# punnett_square_gen
This is a punnett square generator for windows command line, written in Python 3.7.
It takes simple allele pairs (e.g. H h) and prints a punnett square showing their possible combinations.
It also finds the ratios of allele pairs in the offspring and prints them as percentages.
